				The SGA (Sheffield Graduates Attributes) is a framework of those attributes 
				that the university has agreed upon regarding academic success, personal 
				development, and employability. These skills can be developed throughout the academic program, during 
				extra-curricular activities, work experiences, and various other activities. 
				The mySkills portfolio is an account of all the attributes and skills a 
				student possesses and tracks their strengths and personal development. <br><br>

				SGA's divided into three sections:<br><br>
				<b>1) MY LEARNING</b><br>
				This includes attributes that are crucial to academics, such as applying 
				knowledge, research and critical thinking, problem-solving, academic writing, 
				digital capabilities, and others. <br><br>

				In various of our modules, such as Foundations of Computer Science and Devices 
				and Networks, we learn basic maths and logic concepts that we have to interpret 
				into computational logic, requiring us to dig deeper into the subject. <br><br>
 
				<b>2) MY IMPACT</b><br>
				This includes attributes related to social and environmental decisions, such 
				as the ability to meet, interact and collaborate with a diverse range of people, 
				making decisions that are appropriate, sustainable, and ethical. <br><br>

				Group assignments in modules such as Introduction to Software Engineering and 
				Machines and Intelligence require us to work with a diverse group of people, 
				which helps increase inclusivity, leadership, collaboration, and community 
				engagement skills.<br><br>

				<b>3) MY SELF</b><br>
				This includes attributes related to developing a positive mindset and well-being 
				for yourself during the sudden changes occurring in your surroundings. <br><br>

				The university provides various support regarding mental health, skill development, 
				innovation, and communication that help students easily adapt to this new environment.
