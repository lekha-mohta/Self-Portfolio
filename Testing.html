				<h4>Optimization </h4><br>
				Optimization was used on images to compress them into smaller sizes so that 
				they could be loaded faster. This helps enhance the quality of images, and 
				faster loading and also allows them to zoom in on pictures for those with 
				visual disabilities. <br><br>
			

				<h4>Debugging </h4><br>
				The W3C HTML and CSS validators were used. For the HTML files, there 
				were no errors but warnings regarding using section tags, as they do 
				not support heading tags. The output for the index.html 
				files can be seen below. <br><br>

				There were no errors in the CSS document as well, as you can see in the 
				image below. <br><br>
