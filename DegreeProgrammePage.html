						This module provides an introduction to Software Engineering concepts necessary 
						to create systems that satisfy the fundamental functional requirements for any 
						given problem. It covers the key steps in the development of such systems, from 
						the analysis to the implementation and testing of the these systems. <br><br>
						 It also includes a teamwork assignment that requires students to develop a web-based 
						software system, giving them experience in teamwork, socialization, and practical
						 experience on the course material taught during lectures.<br><br>

						<p>
							The main goal of this module is the development of mathematical ideas and 
							methods that are fundamental to computer science. It aims to get students 
							excited about these subjects, show why they are important to us, set the 
							groundwork for their knowledge, and get them ready for further study in the 
							later years. Not all computer science-related mathematics is covered in this 
							course. <br><br>

						<img src="images/JAVA1.webp" width="300" height="250" alt="Java Programming">
					</div>
					<div class="degree-text">
						<p>
							Initially, this module introduces JAVA programming concepts, such as program design, 
							use of testing to drive program creation, the ideas of a sequence, selection 
							and repetition. Later, it focuses on the object-oriented approach to build 
							large software systems. Throughout the module, in lectures as well as in 
							assignments, the practice of writing well-structured and readable programs 
							to solve problems is emphasized.<br><br>

					<div class="degree-text">
						<p>
							This module provides insights into AI, and the key concepts and problems
							emerging in real world use of AI, as well as in history. It helps students
							understand the appropriate algorthm and implementing solutions by experimenting 
							on robots, starting of with Miro. It also provides an introduction to 
							programming for software engineering. <br><br>

					</div>
					<div class="degree-text">
						<p>
							In the first part of the module, important elements of computer architecture are 
							covered which include digital logic, computer arithmetic, number systems and 
							instruction set architecture. In the second half, students learn how computing 
							devices can be connected onto networks, error detection and reliable transmission 
							over networks.<br><br>

							The aim of the module is to show how the basic elements of a computer are 
							constructed and combined to give sophisticated architectures that support 
							accelerated performance via cache memory and pipelining. <br><br>

					<div class="degree-text">
						<p>
							The main focus of the module is on practical use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
							in front-end development of interactive websites. It also covers responsive 
							web design, accessibility and legal issues when creating websites and an 
							introduction to information security. This is a semester module, that covers 
							these skills through a project that requires students to build a website from 
							scratch. <br><br>

					<div class="degree-text">
						<p>
							This module introduces students to the design and analysis of efficient 
							algorithms and data structures, techniques for designing efficient algorithms
							including efficient data structures for storing and retrieving data. This is
							done using illustrative and fundamental problems: searching, sorting, graph 
							algorithms, and combinatorial problems such as finding the shortest paths 
							in networks.<br><br>
