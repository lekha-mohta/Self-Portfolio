					<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4><br>
					This project, A Personal Portfolio website, has been created as a Mobile-First 
					Responsive Web Design (i.e. it focuses on mobile users first and then on those 
					accessing the website from a laptop/desktop) and has a simple yet cheerful look. 
					The contrasting color combination, positioning of elements, easy navigation, etc 
					all add up to the entire look of the website.  <br><br> 

					<h4>SITE MAP</h4><br>
					The sitemap of the website looks like the following:<br><br>

					<img src="images/sitemap.jpeg" alt="Site Map">

					<br>
					<br>

					This sitemap is an example of how all the web pages are interlinked and explains 
					the functioning of the website. It also includes all the mentioned links, email IDs, 
					and any other relevant sources of information. <br><br>

					I believe this is a logical structure for the website since there is a valid 
					relationship between all the linked pages and they are grouped by certain categories. 
					Other than that, it also follows the three-click rule (i.e. a user should be able to 
					reach any webpage/link with no more than three mouse clicks.) <br><br>

					<h4>DESIGN MOCK-UPS</h4><br><br>
					<h4>1) BASIC LAYOUT</h4><br>
					The basic layout in mobile webpages consists of a header, body, and footer. The header 
					includes the logo and the menu bar. Upon selecting the menu icon, a list appears that 
					contains links to Home, degree program, SGA, and the quiz webpages. The body content 
					differs slightly in each webpage, but generally includes a white background box that 
					contains all the body elements. The footer is located at the bottom of the page and 
					contains links to the accessibility, design, testing, contact, and, legal and security 
					web pages. <br><br>

					Below is the general design of the web pages in mobile view. <br><br>

					<img src="images/mobilev.jpeg" alt="Mobile View"><br><br>

					On the other hand, in the desktop view, the header contains a navigation bar with the 
					links to Home, degree program, SGA, and the quiz webpages along with the logo. The 
					body and footer are similar to those in the mobile view. <br><br>

					Below is the general design of the web page in desktop view. <br><br>

					<img src="images/desktopv.jpeg" alt="Desktop View"><br><br>


					I have chosen this layout since it is easy to navigate through and is accessible. 
					The navigation bar makes accessing web pages easier and more convenient. <br><br>

					<h4>2) APPEARANCE</h4><br>
					The basic approach behind the chosen color combinations and the positioning of 
					elements is the ease to locate elements and having a pleasing appeal. Increasing 
					the font size also helped to make the content more visible and easy to read. <br><br>

					The color contrasts between the shades of teal and white help increase focus on the 
					information included on each of the pages. Other than that, the grey shadow effect on 
					all of the box elements is specifically for those with disabilities, but also in 
					general to catch people's attention. The highlights on elements in the navigation bar 
					that appear when hovering over them help users understand what they currently are 
					working with. I have used breakpoints for the navigation bar since this helps make it 
					more responsive. <br><br>

					<h4>3) MENU SYSTEMS</h4><br>
					I have chosen the off-canvas navigation system, since this helps save space and is 
					more professional, especially in mobile view. The menu bar includes links to all the 
					web pages so it is easily accessible as well. <br><br>
