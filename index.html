                        Hello. My name is Lekha Mohta. I am a first-year student 
                        at The University of Sheffield studying Bsc Computer Science.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                        I am a Rajasthani, living in Tokyo for the past 15 years. 
                    I completed high school at India International School in Japan and 
                    started University in the UK in late September. My educational 
                    aspirations consist of acquiring a bachelor's degree in Computer 
                    Science that should assist me in pursuing a career as a Data-Scientist.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                        I also enjoy various extracurricular activities. In sports, I play 
                    basketball and badminton. I enjoy playing the piano, dancing, and 
                    also participating in contests. Other than that, in my free time, 
                    I like to attend various volunteering events or otherwise be a part 
                    of the organizing committee.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                     
                        I would consider myself a social person, who enjoys traveling, eating,
                     going out, and just being around people. This website will help you 
                     take a deeper look at my academics. 
                     <br>
                    <br>
                    
                        Hope you enjoy it! Please leave any comments in the form attached 
                     in the Contacts section.
